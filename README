PageRank Calculation using Hadoop's MapReduce framework on wikipedia data

This project contains four tasks:

Task 1:

Parse a XML file by MapReduce. Fetch the <title> and <text> tags. The <text> tag contains wikilinks. 
The wikilinks are matched with a regular expression and they are removed. Form an adjacency graph with
the page titles and wiki-links.

Task 2:

Task 3 and Task 4: Yet to be done.
